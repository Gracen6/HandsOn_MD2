This directory has a script that computes the diffusion coefficient of
a 3d FCC-Cu liquid using Einstein relation.

-------------

The method computes the slope of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the
atoms.  In this case a single time origin is used.  This allows the diffusion coefficient to be estimated
on-the-fly using variables in the LAMMPS input scripts.  For better
statistics you typically want to use multiple time origins,
post-processing the data from dump files.

-------------

Here is how to extract the diffusion coefficient from the log file
output for each method.

The 5rd column of output is the instantaneous mean-squared
displacment, which grows over time.  The 6th column estimates the
slope of the MSD from its two end-points, and uses it to compute the
diffusion coefficient.  The 7th column fits a straight line to the
entire (growing) set of MSD data and uses the slope of the line to
compute the diffusion coefficient.
